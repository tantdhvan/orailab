Around 1.5 billion students, 90% of the world\u2019s elementary, tertiary and secondary students are unable to physically attend school. The effect has been revolutionary, as educators expect technological solutions to support remote education and learning. Digital transformation in education sector is, however, not limited to post COVID-19 online education and learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some educational institutions have used technology solutions for the past years, the importance of digital transformation in education environment has now been realized in most schools and universities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Governments in various countries are seeking to mitigate the immediate effects of closures and promote the continuity of education for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many schools provide students with remote learning, although some of them are planning to return to the modern standard and with new technology solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is digital transformation in education?<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital Transformation involves improving the core business processes of a company to effectively fulfill customer expectations through data and technology leveraging. In the educational sector, students, faculty, staff and graduates can be the target consumer and both students and professors can benefit from digital transformation in schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital transformation to enhance student experience may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enabling students to enter through the mobile app or web application.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing a broad range of choices for online learning.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using technology to track the progress of students and enforce intervention protocols.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enabling online class organization faculties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key areas of digital transformation in education<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use of classroom coaching technologies<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After the pandemic, the coaching of classes has been closed in schools, colleges and conventional bricks and mortar institutes. Nearly all institutions have been adapted to digital education approaches. However, the learning findings are also unclear. Now that the outbreak of Covid seems to be under control and schools and colleges gradually start teaching, parents are uncertain that they can send their wards to the institution. This has pushed institutions to accept the digital educational transformation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanitation and thermal screening it will be mandatory to calculate the temperature of students and teachers. Adequate sanitation and control of health would also gain ground. It is easy to recognize if a student and teacher who is contaminated comes into contact with another person and is taking precautionary actions. Daily health checks in institutions can have secondary benefits. Students\u2019 health is always unaffected and their academic performance is hampered. Possessing health problems promptly helps increase your learning skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contactless attendance Restaurants use a contactless menu. You can search for a QR code for a menu by using your mobile phones. Institutions may also take advantage of this technology. By scanning their ID cards or using a face recognition device, students can record their attendance. Daily biometric participation would soon be uncontactable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social distance control system AI-based systems have been used in some jurisdictions to monitor public meetings and prevent the virus spread. These technologies can also be used by educational institutions to enforce social distance and to track health standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/piditi.com\/strapi\/uploads\/classroom_coaching_technologies_7e01a14b3d.jpg\" alt=\"classroom-coaching-technologies.jpg\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use of admission technology<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The method of admission or registration is usually very time-consuming. To apply for admission and send papers, students must wait in the queue. You must also periodically visit the institution to verify the status of your submission. The admissions team has to review records, verify qualifications, list students, and update them with their application status on the administrative front.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new age enrollment process would be accessible online for all \u2013 parents, students, teachers and administration \u2013 as the processes operated up to the pandemic. The organizations can be supported in the following ways through a whole application process:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Institutions should prevent paperwork in connection with the process of admission. Technology will automatically assist in selecting suitable applicants. Routine inquiries can be offloaded by an automated response system. Institutions will update classes, faculty, students, etc. in real-time. Students should not have to wait in queues and waste time for their applications to monitor their status. Students may apply simultaneously without visiting the campus at many institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/piditi.com\/strapi\/uploads\/Use_of_admission_technology_768x499_7922409c8d.jpg\" alt=\"Use-of-admission-technology-768x499.jpg\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Transforming the EdTech models<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of your own training. It is possible that there were chalkboards, overhead ventures and voluminous books. The chalkboards were replaced by digital whiteboards, the overhead screens with interactive front-of-class showings and the bulky books with digital tablet versions, thanks to the overall digital transformation of the education sector. These EdTech devices promote this technical transition fully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Experimentation and feedback<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In taking into account the ever-connected status of EdTech, teachers have the tools to experiment infinitely and to provide almost instant feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plenty of resources<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>EdTech will never again make teachers think about resource constraints! When the native software of an interactive whiteboard is taken into account with its Internet access, there are virtually endless opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Automation and efficiency<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that teaching is full of bothersome, but important lateral activities that eventually detract from the objective. This includes classification, participation, communication, and all the educational activities. Teacher\u2019s newly acquired EdTech tools may delegate those administrative distractions. Those who use EdTech devices correctly therefore might find that their teaching experience is much more effective every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Life skill development<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>They are set to live by introducing students, especially the younger, to this technology. In practice, events include literacy and the development of multimedia presentations. There is no better time to study than when brains still grow by considering technology to use a life education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transformation in teaching &amp; learning methodologies Digital transformation in the teaching-learning process will include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online learning video integration<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, schools took technologies such as Zoom and Google Meet for the conduct of video conferences for classes. In a broth, institutions were present at student attendance and conducting examinations online. But organizations now can integrate their website with these resources and re-establish a seamless lesson experience on a digital basis through overnight technology advances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning from AR\/VR<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Augmented and virtual reality is growing in education extensively. Enhanced reality is an immersive environment in the physical world where computerized perceptual knowledge improves real-world artifacts. On the other hand, virtual reality is a simulation of a 3D environment that people can interact using VR glasses or headgears. These technologies make subjects like History, Geography, Biology come to life. For instance, Cleveland University clinic trained anatomy and surgery by AR-based 3D human modeling at Case Western Reserve University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/piditi.com\/strapi\/uploads\/AR_learning_768x512_020f99dcc9.jpg\" alt=\"AR-learning-768x512.jpg\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gamification<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educators will help children retain subjects eidetically by means of a splendid learning strategy. Gamified learning is very common in K12 education and is gradually becoming widespread in the vocational training and testing sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intellectual exam portals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities also face challenges in evaluation and grading. Often, students struggle to pass unfair examinations. Institutions should incorporate webcams into their online exam portals in order to avoid this. It will help you to monitor suspicious activities like opening tabs, chat boxing in the background, picture exchange and more while you take your test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning experience platform<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine an LXP as a student\u2019s mental guide. Unlike a learning management system (LMS), which offers a one-way learning roadmap, LXP offers autonomy. For instance, an LMS provides 1,2,3 and so forth in the order. On the other hand, LXP provides curated content according to the speed and preference of the students. An LXP offers the option of curriculum flows rather than a predefined curriculum.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that has affected the world\u2019s economies has also stifled the education industry.
